# Intermittent Blank FlatList in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React Native `FlatList` component sometimes renders blank, even when data has been successfully fetched from an API. The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce reliably.

## Bug Description

The `FlatList` component consistently remains empty despite the API request returning a successful response with valid data.  Debugging shows the data is correctly parsed and available in the component's state. The problem only occurs occasionally, and no clear pattern has been identified.  The issue has been observed on different emulators and devices. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding a `ListEmptyComponent` to gracefully handle cases where data isn't immediately available or is empty.  Additionally, logging statements have been added for improved debugging.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to run the application.
